#+TITLE: Audient EVO 4 Pulseaudio profile
#+DATE: <2020-05-11 Mon>

Recently I bought myself an audio interface. For those not familiar
with that term, it's a USB connected device which you can use to
capture sound from microphones into your computer.

During my research to find the perfect interface for me I was looking
for an interface that has proper support for GNU/Linux. But it was
really hard to find information about this, for almost any interface.

So I ended up buying myself an Audient EVO 4. It's a fairly new
interface, but I've watched several reviews, and they were are very
popular. I bought it [[https://www.thomann.de/be/audient_evo_4.htm][from Thomann]], because they have a 30 day money
back guarantee, so I had some time to figure out if it worked with my
computer.

If you don't like the story you can just skip to the [[*The solution][solution]]
or the [[*EVO 4
 review][review]].

** Plug-and-play

When the EVO 4 arrived, I plugged it in, and it worked straight
out-of-the-box.

It is a really fun interface, I really enjoyed from the start. But
quickly ran into an issue.

** Loopback

This interface has a feature called: loopback. It allows you to not
only record the sound from the microphone inputs, but also the sound
comming from the computer itself. It's designed to record singing, or
whatever, together with the music that's playing on your computer. But
in my case, that gave me issues.

Audient has drivers for the EVO 4 for macOS and Windows, but not for
GNU/Linux. The drivers create separate devices for each input, and
also one for loopback audio. But the generic drivers on GNU/Linux only
create one device: all the inputs combined. And here is where the
trouble comes in. To explain, let me illustrate my setup.

#+begin_src ditaa :file ./content/evo4-pulseaudio-profile/evo4-connections.png
                   +------+
                   |  PC  |
                   +---+--+

  +------------+   +---+---+    +-----+
  | headphones +---+ EVO 4 +----+ Mic |
  +------------+   +-------+    +-----+
#+end_src

So when I use the EVO 4 during video calls with colleagues my
microphone audio will get mixed with the audio of all other
participants, so people will hear them self again.

I contacted support, but no one could help me and they just gave me
the message: "Linux is not supported".

Luckily, I friend of mine suggested to raise my issue on an online
forum, so [[https://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?t=21347][I did]].

** Unfixable?

For a while I thought my problem was unfixable, because I considered
the inputs were joined in hardware, and there was nothing I could do
about.

But [[https://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?p=117643#p117643][a comment]] from the kind user =puleglot= gave me hope. I did add
the following line to my ~~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf~:

#+begin_src conf
remixing-use-all-sink-channels = no
#+end_src

After restarting the pulse daemon with ~pulseaudio --kill~ the
loopback audio was gone. Great! But this created another issue: input
1 ended up only on the left side of the input channel, and input 2
only on the right side. So not ideal. But it gave me hope.

** A lot of tinkering

=puleglot= helped me out and after some back and forth I figured out
the configuration for the EVO 4, you can read all about it in the
forum thread I posted earlier.

** The solution

Tell ~pulseaudio~ to use a custom profile, so create
~/etc/udev/rules.d/91-pulseaudio-custom-profiles.rules~ with the
following content:

#+begin_src conf
SUBSYSTEM=="sound",  SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="change", KERNEL=="card*", ENV{ID_VENDOR}=="Audient", ENV{ID_MODEL}=="EVO4", ENV{PULSE_PROFILE_SET}="/etc/pulse/profile-sets/audient-evo4.conf"
#+end_src

And place this in the ~/etc/pulse/profile-sets/audient-evo4.conf~
file:

#+begin_src conf
[General]
auto-profiles = yes


[Mapping mic-input]
description = Mic
device-strings = hw:%f
channel-map = mono,mono,aux1,aux1
paths-input = analog-input-mic
direction = input
priority = 1

[Mapping multichannel-input]
description = Multichannel
device-strings = hw:%f
channel-map = front-left,front-right,front-center,lfe
paths-input = multichannel-input
direction = input
priority = 2


[Mapping analog-surround-40]
description = Analog Surround 4.0
device-strings = front:%f
channel-map = front-left,front-right,front-center,lfe
paths-output = analog-output
direction = output
priority = 1


[Profile output:analog-surround-40+input:mic-input]
description = Analog Surround 4.0 Output + Mic Input
output-mappings = analog-surround-40
input-mappings = mic-input
priority = 100
skip-probe = yes

[Profile output:analog-surround-40+input:multichannel-input]
description = Analog Surround 4.0 Output + Multichannel Input
output-mappings = analog-surround-40
input-mappings = multichannel-input
priority = 60
skip-probe = yes
#+end_src

To apply these settings, run:

#+begin_src sh
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=sound
pulseaudio --kill
#+end_src

Now if you open up ~pavucontrol~ you'll have different profiles
available.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt PulseAudio sound profiles for the EVO 4
[[./content/evo4-pulseaudio-profile/evo4-pavucontrol-profiles.png]]

These are pretty self-explanatory. If you only like the microphone
inputs select "Mic Input", if also like to include loopback audio
select "Multichannel Input". So now I can select the profile I want,
depending on the situation.

** EVO 4 review

I have this interface for a month now, and it's really great.

The LEDs around the dial are my favorite. When you turn the knob, it
shows the selected gain, and if you don't touch it it shows the volume
of the selected input/ouput. And the dial works also great to
configure the monitor mix.

I haven't used the Smart Gain that much, but the input buttons also
light up red when they clip, so that also helps to set the gain
correctly.

So even with 1 dial you have a lot of control.

I like you can mute the inputs, but the "hold to mute/unmute" is a bit
cumbersome if you want to switch it on/off quickly.

It has a nice form factor, and with the inputs on the back, it stands
nicely on my desk.

I would definitely recommend this to any beginner, it's a great piece
of hardware.
