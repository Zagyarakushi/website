#+TITLE: Org mode blogging: Unfurling links
#+DATE: <2018-12-26 Wed>
#+DESCRIPTION: An explanation on what is needed to make your blog links unfurl nicely on Slack, Twitter, and other sites.

Recently I migrated this blog to Org mode. I already wrote [[file:org-blogging-clickable-headlines.org][one piece]]
about this. This is a second piece...

** Open Graph

Apps like Slack and Twitter can give a nice preview of your blog
article links. Some people call this "unfurling".

I've found several resources which explain what is needed to have
those nice previews. It turns out, they use the "Open Graph" standard.

+ The [[http://ogp.me/][official Open Graph protocol]] info page
+ A [[https://neilpatel.com/blog/open-graph-meta-tags/][blog post]] by [[https://twitter.com/JacekBlaut][Jacek Blaut]]
+ The [[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/opengraph/][Facebook Open Graph reference]]

So I needed to add these =<meta>= tags to my HTML output.

** Expanding Org publish

Org mode publishing allows you to set =:html-head-extra=. This can be
used to add more tags to the =<head>= of your HTML
output. Unfortunately, it does not accept a function for this
property. So I wrote a wrapper function around
=(org-html-publish-to-html)= which dynamically sets the property for
each =.org= file that is processed.

It's not the most beautiful function, but [[https://gitlab.com/to1ne/blog/blob/master/elisp/publish.el#L69-112][it works]].

** Results

Linking this page on Slack will look like:
