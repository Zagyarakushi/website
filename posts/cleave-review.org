#+TITLE: CLEAVE Review
#+DATE: <2022-07-27 Wed>

The nice people at Truly Ergonomic sent me a CLEAVE keyboard to review, so here
we go.

** First impressions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: first-impressions
:END:

Ever since [[file:truly-ergonomic-full-review.org][the original Truly Ergonomic keyboard]] I've been loving the design.
Many /ergonomic/ don't look particularly good, but I think TE does an awesome
job on the aesthetics.

The case is made from aluminum and is beautifully anodized in a dark gray, with
a blue shine. The edges are chamfered and shiny, which gives a nice touch. The
case also acts as a plate for the switches, so they sit on top of the case,
which gives the keyboard a barebones but spacey look.

The wrist rests are comfy, and are a big improvement compared to the previously
model. Because the case is less thick, the rests are taller, and have a little
more give to it. But they are made from high quality material, and I'm sure they
will last a long time.

When taking the keyboard from the box I noticed the cable is attached. The
keyboard has a fixed USB cable, and it has a USB type-A connector. I'm sad it's
not detachable. It would be more convenient if the keyboard had female USB
type-C connector which would allow you to plug in any cable you like. Personally
that's something I'd expect from a keyboard in this price range. Nevertheless
it's nice there are gutters in the bottom of the keyboard to guide the
cable to the left or right side of the keyboard.

** Keycaps

When I plugged in the keyboard, the backlighting lit up. It makes the keycaps
pop. They did a great job positioning the LEDs under the switches so the legends
light up brightly and evenly. The sublegends on the function keys, on the top
row, don't light up though, that gives them a nice contrast.

The feel of the keycaps is a bit flimsy, comparing them to high-end custom
keycaps. The walls of these keycaps, so the thickness of the material, is about
half of what I'm used to. It will be fine for most people, but I would have
appreciated thicker caps.

The 2U keycaps in the thumb area feel great. I'm happy they moved away from the
custom shaped caps in the center, and use standard sized keycaps now.

And because the switches have standard Cherry MX styled stems, you can always
replace the caps with most of the sets you find on the aftermarket.

** Switches
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: switches
:END:

The unit that was shipped to me came with clicky switches. That would have been
my least favorite choice, but I didn't chose them. For clicky switches they
deliver what they are supposed to. They are noisy and tactile.

The switches are custom made for Truly Ergonomic and don't use mechanical metal
contacts to determine actuation. Instead, they operate optically, where the
switch will let a beam of infrared light pass through when pressed. This is very
reliable. This mechanism should be completely free from any key chatter, in
contrary to the previous model I own. But it's a custom solution build by them
and does not allow you to interchange switches with other brands.

One thing I noticed though, and it might only be true for the clicky switches,
but it seems to me these switches sometimes actuate before you get the tactile
feedback. So you can type a letter without having the switch do /click/. To me
this is annoying. In some cases I thought the keyboard suffered from chatter,
but I think in these cases I might have pushed a key twice, while it only
clicked once. Confusing.

** Backlight
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: backlight
:END:

You can tweak the backlight of the keyboard with a few hot keys, which is nice.
You also can program backlight patterns where you can program for each key
individually if it's backlight is ON/OFF. This is cool, but it's a gimmick and
not very useful.

** Programmable
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: programmable
:END:

In terms of being programmable, I think this is where the keyboard lacks some
features. There are a limited number of keys (i.e. the 2U keys in the thumb
area) you can reprogram, but that's about it. You can also switch between
Windows and Mac modifier keys.

For me this is a big issue. I've been using Colemak for quite some time now, and
there is no way how I can load this in the keyboard. So I'm stuck at relearning
QWERTY again, which turned out to be more painful than expected.

I asked their support about it, and they gave me a lengthy response basically
saying I should remap the keys in the computer OS or with a third-party software
tool. Quite disappointing.

On my other keyboards I also use [[https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods][home row modifiers]], which puts Ctrl/Shift/Alt
right at my fingertips. This means when I for example tap and hold ~T~, it acts
like a Control. So on the CLEAVE I have to reach far with my pinky to find Ctrl
& Alt. The Windows key is positioned right in the middle of nowhere, really
annoying if have it attached to a lot of shortcuts in your window manager.

So I'm sad something like QMK, ZMK, or VIA is not supported. Using one of these
would have given them so many features for /free/. For example Kinesis adopted
ZMK in their newest Advantage 360, and that's smart.

Maybe they considered using a open-source firmware, but didn't because they
wanted to keep the implementation details of optical switches a secret, and not
publish it as open source software. But it goes at the cost of adding a ton of
customizations to the keyboard.

** Conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
:END:

This keyboard is definitely a big improvement compared to the previous version.
It is a great entry point for people into ergonomic keyboards. Owners are
limited to only 3 types of switches, that's probably plenty for most users who
don't plan to dive deep in the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards.

I've tested this keyboard for a couple of weeks. I could get used to the QWERTY
layout, but having the modifier keys so far out of reach stopped me from using
it as a daily driver.

This CLEAVE is absolutely great from hardware perspective, but it lacks in
software. If Truly Ergonomics would manage to make it more customizable, I would
definitely recommend this keyboard.
